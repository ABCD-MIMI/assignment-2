    <br><b>Scope of var, let, and const:</b></br>

        var: It is function scoped, meaning it's only available within the function it's declared in. If it's not in any function, then it is globally scoped.</br>
        
        let: Unlike var, let is block-scoped. Here, its scope is limited within the block, statement, or expression where it is defined.</br>
        
        const: Just like let, const is also block-scoped. However, itâ€™s a constant reference to a value, meaning you can't reassign it to a new value.</br>
        
        <b>Use Cases of null and undefined:</b></br>
        
        null: null represents the intentional absence of any object value. It's often used when you want to express the concept of "no value" or "no object" intentionally.</br>
        
        undefined: undefined is given to a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value, whether it's object, function, number or any other type.</br>
        
        <b>REST API:</b></br>
        
        REST (Representational State Transfer) API is a set of principles for designing network applications. It utilizes HTTP protocols for creating, reading, updating or deleting data (known as CRUD operations). It makes interactions between clients and services easy since it uses a streamlined, stateless, cacheable communication protocol that is standardized all over the world.</br>
        
        Examples of these standard HTTP methods within RESTful principles include:</br>
        
        1.GET for reading data</br>
        2.POST for creating data</br>
        3.PUT for updating data</br>
        4.DELETE for deleting data</h3>
